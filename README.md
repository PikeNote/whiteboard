<h1 align="center">Virtual Whiteboard</h1>
Hello! This our team (Team Procrasination)'s submission for Hack the Northeast!

This is our virtual whiteboard which you can try it out [here](https://home.virtualwhiteboard.tech/).

The whiteboard allows students and teachers to join one room and be able to share drawings on a single whiteboard. There are many moderation features that allow you control the rooms on top of the expansive set of features like marker size and color control.  
  
This project was written using Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
The core technology at the heart of the project is the websocket which allows the client and server to communicate with each other.
